# Moin!

Once again I want to start learning Bevy for some fun rust game development. Mixed with new years resolutions I also never follow, I want to start experimenting with this blazingly fast game engine.

Of course the first session consisted of 94% setup of a semi-related (non, if I'm honest to myself), future Bevy AI Agent God setup, which I want to build up simultaneously to this learning series. As if learning Rust, ECS, and Bevy wouldn't be enough.

## The Goal

The Goal is getting back into Game Development, while learning stuff I'm interested in (Rust). Also I feel like I have to learn something new and challenging, because most of the time now I work with the same tech and tools, or better watch AI work with my tech and tools.

## First Project Idea

Even though I studied Game Development and work with a Game Engine, my first idea or goal to work on in Bevy is a "Node Editor" like for Visual Scripting, Workflow Engines or Shader Tools. I really like to work with those systems and think its a very interesting project that has a wide complexity range, from simple squares in an "infinite" 2D space to an real time data simulation flow system with sub workflows etc.

## What's Next

My plan is to make small blog posts where I tell a bit about my experience with Bevy and my many pitfalls I will face. Also I will create a public repo where you can look into the masterwork of code.

I hope I will get some interactions with you guys along the way, which would really help me to keep me motivated.
